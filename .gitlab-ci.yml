  # Since we require Maven for this job,
  # we can restrict the job to runners with a certain tag.
  # Of course, it is our duty to actually configure a runner
  # with the tag 'maven' and a working maven installation

    - maven
  # Here you can execute arbitrate terminal commands.
  # If any of the commands returns a non zero exit code the job fails.
