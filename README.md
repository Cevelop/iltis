# ILTIS Testing

Enhanced testing and tooling for **Eclipse CDT C/C++** plug-in projects.

> create new version using JavaSE-11 and most recent Eclipse Relase (2021-12, CDT10.5) on Branch Develop-PS
> mainly to support M1 macs as well

## Installation

TODO Update as soon as update site is defined

The plugins contained in **ch.hsr.ifs.iltis.testing** are grouped into four
features that are all available via
`https://www.cevelop.com/cdt-testing/<eclipse-codename>/` where you need to
substitute `<eclipse-codename>` for the codename of the eclipse release you are
using (e.g **neon**). So if you are using **Eclipse Neon**, you would use this
URL:

  https://www.cevelop.com/cdt-testing/neon/

To access ***unstable*** development builds, use:

  https://www.cevelop.com/cdt-testing/development/

**NOTE**: These plugin-features are designed to be used by developers an we
closely track the current release of **Eclipse CDT**. Older versions might work
but the only supported version is the current release.

### IFS CDT-Testing Feature (ch.hsr.ifs.cdttesting.feature)

This feature is designed to be added to the *Target Platform Definition* of a
plug-in project. It contains *org.eclipse.cdt.tests* which provides the basic
functionality to run **Junit4** based plug-in test for **Eclipse CDT**
plug-ins. It also contains extensions that enable:

* re-running a single test
* automatic setup of the **Eclipse CDT** index
* inclusion of external resources (headers, etc.)
* testing against other referenced projects
* testing of C (non-C++) projects.

### IFS CDT-Testing Tools Feature (ch.hsr.ifs.cdttesting.tools.feature)

This feature can be used in **Eclipse PDE** to ease creating tests for a
plug-in. It includes **Showoffset** - a plugin that allows you to find specific
offsets in a file as well as getting offset-information from a selection -,
**pASTa (Painless AST Analysis)** - a plugin that enables you to explore the
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of a C++ source file - and the **Testfileeditor** -
an editor designed to assist in the creation of **Eclipse CDT RTS** test files.

#### Showoffset

This plugins makes it easy to find specific offsets in files as well as to
obtain an offset from a selection. This is especially useful when you need
to check exact position information in you plug-in tests. The plug-in add two
new button to the main **Eclipse** toolbar:

![Show offset and go-to offset](media/images/showoffset-buttons.png?raw=true "Show offset and go-to offset")

The left button allows you to enter the offset as well as the length of a
selection and jumps to the newly created selection, while the right button
converts a selection into a tuple of offset and length.

#### pASTa (Painless AST Analysis

pASTa (from *painless AST analysis*) is a plugin that allows you to explore the
**Eclipse CDT** AST of C++ translation units. In addition to providing a tree
based view of your source-code, it also provides a detail inspector for AST
nodes.

**NOTE**: pASTa is also available as a separate feature to make it easy to
install in **Eclipse CDT**.

##### The pASTa AST View

The pASTa *AST View* enables you to explore the AST of a C++ translation unit
in the same way it is represented in **Eclipse CDT**. The nodes of the tree use
the exact names of the actual classes you would use in you plug-in since pASTa
is indeed a one-to-one mapping of the AST.

![The pASTa AST View](media/images/pasta-tree-view.png?raw=true "The pASTa AST View")

To enable the pASTa *AST View*, use the menu ***Window -> Show View -> Other***.
Alternatively, you can use the Keyboard shortcut ***Shift+Alt+Q Q***. In the
dialog that opens, you can either search for *AST View* or navigate to the
folder *Painless AST Analysis*. Simply double-click the entry *AST View* to
open the pASTa *AST View* in your workbench. You can move around the pASTa *AST
View* as any other view in your **Eclipse** workbench.

**NOTE**: When changing the to another file, you need to refresh the pASTa *AST
View* by clicking on the ***refresh*** button in the upper right hand corner of
the pASTa *AST View*.

##### The pASTa Node View

The pASTa *Node View* provides you with information about the currently
selected tree node. It completes your view of the **Eclipse CDT** AST by giving
you information about the inheritance structure, fields, methods, etc. of any
given node.

![The pASTa Node View](media/images/pasta-node-view.png?raw=true "The pASTa Node View")

This is an indispensable feature for people that are new to developing with the
**Eclipse CDT** AST as well as seasoned developers. To enable the pASTa *Node
View*, use the menu ***Window -> Show View -> Other***. Alternatively, you can
use the keyboard shortcut ***Shift+Alt+Q Q***. In the dialog that opens, you
can either search for *Node View* or navigate to the folder *Painless AST
Analysis*. Simply double-click the entry *Node View* to open the pASTa *Node
View* in you workbench. You can move around the pASTa *Node View* as any other
view in your **Eclipse** workbench.

#### Testfileeditor

The *Testfileeditor* is an editor that was specifically designed to ease the
creation of **Eclipse CDT RTS** test files. Once installed, the
*Testfileeditor* will automatically be associated with all RTS test files and
provide:

* RTS syntax highlighting
* virtual-file-relative line numbers
* an outline of you test file
* the ability to jump to specific tests from the JUnit page

##### RTS syntax highlighting and line numbers

![RTS editor](media/images/rts-editor-content.png?raw=true "The RTS editor content")

**Eclipse CDT** uses its own description language for test files called RTS.
This language makes use of C-Style comments to mark the different sections of
test file. This allows you to easily define which C/C++ source files the
testing framework shall generate, as well as defining before-and-after sections
for refactoring tests and selection for selection based actions. Since these
test files can contain as many test as you like, they tend to become long and
hard to handle. *Testfileeditor* aids you in handling large test files by
providing syntax highlighting for the **Eclipse CDT RTS** language as well as
line number that are relative to each virtual file contained in a test file.
These feature greatly ease navigation in large test files as well as
determining on which virtual line a marker is expected when testing **Codan**
based checker plugins.

##### Test file outline

![RTS outline](media/images/rts-editor-outline.png?raw=true "The RTS editor outline")

To make you even faster in navigating large test files, *Testfileeditor*
comes with support for outlining your test files in the **Eclipse** standard
outline page. Simply double click on a test, virtual file or before-and-after
section to jump directly to the associated position in the test file.

##### Duplicate test detection

![RTS duplicate detection](media/images/rts-editor-duplicate-annotation.png?raw=true "The RTS editor duplicate detection")

The **Eclipse CDT RTS** test execution environment does not detect is there are
multiple definitions for the same test. Instead, it simply picks one of them
and runs it, while the other definitions will be silently ignored. This can
lead to the false believe, that all tests have run successfully, since there is
no way, using the standard tools provided by **Eclipse PDE**, to detect this
situation.

This is where the Testfileeditor comes into play. It scans your currently open
file for duplicate test definitions and marks them directly in the editor,
using a marker similar to the ones you are used to from
**Eclipse CDT/PDE/JDT**.

![RTS duplicate log](media/images/rts-editor-duplicate-log.png?raw=true "The RTS editor duplicate log")

In addition to the markers in the currently open editor, you can also access
the problems via the built-in **Problems** view. From there, you can jump
directly to the offending definition.

##### Jump to RTS

![Jump to RTS](media/images/rts-editor-jumptorts.png?raw=true "Jump to RTS")

When tests fail in large test files it is often cumbersome to find the
description of the failing test. *Testfileeditor* augments the **Eclipse**
built-in JUnit page by adding a context menu entry called *Jump to RTS* that
allows you to jump directly to the definition of the failing test.

### Example Code (ch.hsr.ifs.cdttesting.example.feature)

This feature contains an example project to familiarize yourself with the
**Eclipse CDT** testing infrastructure. You can import the example code via
the ***File->Import...*** wizard. Simply search for *Plug-ins and Fragments* in
the wizard or navigate to the *Plug-in Development* folder. On the next page,
make sure to select *Project with source folders* in the *Import as* group.
Click *Next* and select the plug-in *ch.hsr.ifs.cdttesting.example* for import.

After the import has finished, you can run the example unit tests by
right-clicking the *TestSuiteAll.java* file in the
*ch.hsr.ifs.cdttesting.example* package and selecting
***Run as... -> JUnit Plug-in Test***. You can find the associated test files
in the *resources* folder of the project.
